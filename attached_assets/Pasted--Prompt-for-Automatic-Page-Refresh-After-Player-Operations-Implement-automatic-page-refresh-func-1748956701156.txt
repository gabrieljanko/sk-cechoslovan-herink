**Prompt for Automatic Page Refresh After Player Operations**

Implement automatic page refresh functionality for all player management operations to ensure the UI displays updated data immediately without requiring manual page refresh.

**Required Auto-Refresh Triggers:**

1. **After Adding a New Player:**
   - When the "Add New Player" modal is successfully submitted
   - Trigger refresh immediately after the player is created in the database
   - Close the modal and refresh the page to show the new player in the list

2. **After Editing a Player:**
   - When the "Edit Player" modal is successfully submitted with changes
   - Trigger refresh immediately after the player data is updated in the database
   - Close the modal and refresh the page to show the updated player information

3. **After Removing a Player:**
   - When a player is successfully deleted (likely through a delete option in the player's menu)
   - Trigger refresh immediately after the player is removed from the database
   - Refresh the page to show the updated player list without the deleted player

**Implementation Requirements:**

- Use `window.location.reload()` or equivalent page refresh method
- Ensure the refresh only occurs AFTER successful server response (not on failed operations)
- Maintain the current page state (stay on the Players tab, preserve any filters if applicable)
- Consider showing a brief loading indicator during the refresh process
- Handle any potential race conditions between the database update and page refresh

**Error Handling:**
- Only refresh on successful operations
- Display appropriate error messages for failed operations without refreshing
- Ensure user doesn't lose their place in the interface on errors

**User Experience:**
- The refresh should feel seamless and immediate
- User should see their changes reflected instantly
- No manual refresh required from the user

This will significantly improve the user experience by ensuring data consistency and eliminating the need for manual page refreshes after player management operations.
